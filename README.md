- 👋 Hi, I’m @toopkungza
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, python and C/C++, and many great things computers can do nowadays. :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning natural language processing, data visualization, and statistical analysis (linear and logistic regression analysis) on Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating on any projects that don't judge how unprofessional I am :P
- 📫 Well, you can google my Github name.. That's the clue.
